# Machine Learning-Based Fraud Detection

This project uses an stacked ensmble of base models (random forest and gradiant boosting) and meta model (logistic resgression) to detect fraudulent transactions in real-time. It includes preprocessing, model training with SMOTE, prediction interface, and model explainability via SHAP.
